# TODO List API Application

## Objective
Develop a scalable and well-designed TODO list API application that allows users to manage their TODOs, demonstrating your backend development skills, API design expertise, and software engineering best practices.

## Project Overview
The TODO List API Application is intended to provide a robust and efficient way for users to create, manage, and track their tasks through a well-structured API. This project showcases proficiency in backend development and adherence to modern software engineering standards.

## Core Features
- **TODOs CRUD Operations**
  - Each TODO includes:
    - **Unique ID**: A distinct identifier for each task.
    - **Name**: A short title for the task.
    - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the task.
    - **Due Date**: The deadline for task completion.
    - **Status**: Current state of the task (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- **Filtering**: Ability to filter TODOs by attributes such as status or due date.
- **Sorting**: Option to sort TODOs by fields like due date, status, or name.

## Nice-to-have Features
- Additional attributes for each TODO (e.g., priority levels, tags for categorization).
- User authentication and registration for personalized task management.
- Team features to enable collaboration on shared tasks.
- Authorization mechanisms (e.g., role-based access control) for secure access.
- Real-time collaboration features (e.g., shared TODO lists, live activity feeds).
- DevOps integration (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm) for deployment.
- An architecture diagram to illustrate the system design.
- Any other innovative improvements or features youâ€™d like to propose.

## Design Requirements
- **Technical Design**
  - Adhere to **SOLID principles** to ensure maintainable and scalable code.
  - Implement **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** to validate functionality.
  - Maintain consistency in code and design throughout the project.
- **API Design**
  - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for endpoints and resources.
  - Implement proper model mapping (e.g., DTOs, ViewModels) for data transfer.
- **Documentation**
  - Include a **README** with detailed instructions for setup and usage.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation of API endpoints and their functionality.

## Deliverables
- A **GitHub repository** containing the complete source code.
- A **Swagger document** or **Postman collection** detailing the API endpoints.
- Be prepared to present a **live demo** during the upcoming interview, showcasing:
  - Core features in action.
  - Code structure and organization.
  - A fully functional application running locally (ensure your development environment is set up beforehand).

## Guidelines
- Use a modern backend programming language and framework, such as:
  - **ASP.NET Core**
  - **Python** with Flask or Django
  - **Node.js** with Express
  - **Java** with Spring Boot
  - Or any other suitable modern stack.
- Select an appropriate database for storing TODOs and user data, such as:
  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **MongoDB**
  - **MySQL**
  - **MSSQL**
- Implement **error handling** and **validations** for all API requests to ensure robustness.
- Write **unit tests** and **integration tests** to cover core functionality.
- Ensure the application can be easily run and tested locally by others.
